# **Math Program**

*Header File (math.h)*

The files consisting of the math program are the math.h header file and the math.c file. The header file defines the function with the integer data type that when implemented calls for 2 individual number values and an operator value to be used within the function that will return a value based on the operation performed between the two numbers.

*Implementation (math.c)*

Within the implementation file, selecting the operator is done with if statement which have a list of predefined options that the user can choose from below:

 Add (num1 + num2)
 
 Subtract (num1 - num2)
 
 Multiply (num1 * num2)
 
 Divide (num1 / num2)
 
 Modulus (num1 % num2)
 
 Left Shift (num1 << num2)
 
 Right Shift (num1 >> num2)
 
 Bitwise AND (num1 & num2)
 
 Bitwise OR (num1 | num2)
 
 Bitwise XOR (num1 ^ num2)
 
 Bitwise Inverse (~num1)
